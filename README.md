# A314-1000-PCB
A314 board for the A1000's front memory expansion bay

The board has been tested in a first alpha iteration, where a couple of small issues were found and remedied.
It is now being sent for a second production run at JLC, with some small modifications:
- RTC is now more clearly marked as optional in the schematics.
- The addition of an equally optional I2C header, for those of you who wish to expand with other I2C peripherals.
